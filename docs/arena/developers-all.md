## API Overview
The Are.na REST API provides programmatic access to the Are.na platform - a tool for connecting ideas and building knowledge together.

## Getting Started

All API requests use `https://api.are.na` as the base URL. Responses are JSON with consistent structure including hypermedia links for resource discovery.

## Authentication

Most endpoints work without authentication but provide additional access when authenticated. Use the standard `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

**Supported Token Types:**
- **OAuth2 Access Token**: Obtained via [OAuth2 flow](https://www.are.na/developers/explore/authentication) (supports PKCE)
- **Personal Access Token**: From [are.na/settings/oauth](https://www.are.na/settings/personal-access-tokens)

For OAuth2, note that the authorization endpoint is hosted on the main site (`www.are.na/oauth/authorize`),
while the token endpoint is on the API (`api.are.na/v3/oauth/token`). The authorization endpoint supports
`read` and `write` scopes (defaulting to `read` if omitted). A typical authorization URL looks like:

```
https://www.are.na/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&scope=read
```

**Authentication Levels:**
- **Public**: No authentication needed (e.g., `/v3/ping`)
- **Optional**: Works unauthenticated but respects permissions when authenticated
- **Required**: Returns `401 Unauthorized` without valid token (e.g., `/v3/me`)

## Scopes

OAuth2 tokens and personal access tokens support the following scopes:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `read` | Read-only access (default) — write operations will return `403 Forbidden` |
| `write` | Full read and write access |

Tokens default to `read` scope. Request `write` scope when creating a token or authorizing an OAuth2 application to enable write access. Read-only tokens can view all resources the user has access to but cannot create, update, or delete anything.

## Rate Limiting

**Acceptable Use**: This API is intended for building applications that integrate with Are.na, not for scraping or bulk data collection. Automated crawling, systematic downloading of content, or any form of structured data harvesting is prohibited. If you need bulk access to data for research or other purposes, please [contact us](mailto:help@are.na) to discuss your use case.

Rate limits are enforced per-minute based on your tier:

| Tier | Requests/Minute |
|------|-----------------|
| Guest (unauthenticated) | 30 |
| Free | 120 |
| Premium | 300 |
| Supporter/Lifetime | 600 |

**The limit is global across the entire API — it is not per-endpoint.** Authenticated requests are counted per account; unauthenticated requests are counted per IP.

Reads and writes have separate budgets. Reads keep a per-minute budget. Writes use both a per-minute burst budget and a per-hour sustained budget.

**Rate Limit Headers** (included in every response):
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The currently binding bucket's limit
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Units left in the currently binding bucket
- `X-RateLimit-Tier`: Current tier (guest/free/premium/supporter)
- `X-RateLimit-Window`: Binding bucket window in seconds
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when the binding bucket resets
- `X-RateLimit-Bucket`: Binding bucket name (`read-minute`, `write-minute`, `write-hour`)
- `X-RateLimit-Cost`: Cost of the current request in budget units
- `X-RateLimit-Policy`: Budget policy for this request class

When you exceed limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with retry timing and an upgrade URL when available.

## Request Validation

All parameters are validated against this OpenAPI specification. Invalid requests return `400 Bad Request` with detailed error messages.

## Error Responses

Errors use standard HTTP status codes with JSON bodies:

```json
{
  "error": "Not Found",
  "code": 404,
  "details": {
    "message": "The resource you requested does not exist"
  }
}
```

Common status codes:
- `400`: Invalid request parameters
- `401`: Authentication required or invalid
- `403`: Insufficient permissions
- `404`: Resource not found
- `408`: Request took too long to process
- `422`: Well-formed request that could not be processed
- `429`: Rate limit exceeded

## Pagination

List endpoints return paginated results. Use these query parameters:
- `page`: Page number (default: 1)
- `per`: Items per page (default: 24, max: 100)

Responses include a `meta` object with pagination info:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {
    "current_page": 1,
    "per_page": 25,
    "total_pages": 5,
    "total_count": 120,
    "next_page": 2,
    "prev_page": null,
    "has_more_pages": true
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

Are.na channels and users can contain thousands of items. The following guidelines will help you build responsive, well-behaved integrations.

### Paginate, Don't Enumerate

Never try to load an entire channel or user's content in one pass. Use `page` and `per` parameters to fetch only the data you need right now. Check `meta.has_more_pages` and load subsequent pages on demand rather than in a loop.

**Do:**
- Fetch the first page and display it immediately
- Load more pages as the user scrolls or explicitly requests them

**Don't:**
- Loop through all pages at startup to "build a complete picture"
- Set `per=100` and iterate until `has_more_pages` is `false`

### Use HTTP Caching

All responses include `Cache-Control` and `ETag` headers. Unauthenticated responses are `max-age=300, public` — your client can reuse them for 5 minutes without any network request. Authenticated responses are `private, no-cache` — your client may store them but must revalidate before each reuse.

To revalidate, send the `ETag` value from a previous response as `If-None-Match`:

```
GET /v3/channels/123
If-None-Match: "abc123"
```

If the resource hasn't changed, the API returns `304 Not Modified` with no body, saving bandwidth. Single-resource endpoints (e.g., `/v3/channels/:id`, `/v3/blocks/:id`) also skip server-side work entirely on a match. Note that 304 responses still count against your rate limit.

### Fetch Summaries Before Details

Start with lightweight list endpoints (e.g., a channel's first page of contents) before drilling into individual blocks or nested resources. Avoid eagerly resolving every connection or nested object — fetch details only when a user explicitly needs them.

### Respect Rate Limits Gracefully

Monitor the `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers. If you receive a `429` response, wait until the reset window before retrying — don't retry in a tight loop. Consider adding exponential backoff and a short delay between sequential requests (e.g., 200–500ms) when making multiple calls.

### Design for Partial Data

Channels can have tens of thousands of connections. Your application should function well with just the first page of results, not require the full dataset upfront. Display what you have and offer the user a way to load more.

### Build Statically When Possible

If you're building a website that displays Are.na content, prefer static site generation (fetching data at build time) over live API requests on every page view. This eliminates rate limit concerns for your visitors and makes your site faster and more resilient. If you need fresher data, cache responses server-side with a reasonable TTL rather than proxying every request through to the API.

### Avoid Write-Heavy Loops

If you're creating or connecting multiple blocks, batch your logic and add delays between write operations. Rapid-fire mutations can hit rate limits quickly and may trigger abuse detection.

### Identify Your Client

Send a `User-Agent` header that names your application and tells us how to reach you. Library defaults like `node`, `python-requests/2.32.5`, or `curl/8.7.1` are shared by thousands of scripts, so if your integration starts causing problems we can't tell it apart from anyone else's — or get in touch with you before limiting it.

Use the form `AppName/version (+contact)`, where the contact is a URL or email address:

```
User-Agent: MyChannelSync/1.2 (+https://example.com; you@example.com)
```

This applies to scripts, bots, server-side rendering (SSR), and anything else making requests from a server or the command line. For requests made directly from browser JavaScript, leave the browser's `User-Agent` unchanged; cross-origin requests normally include your site's `Origin` header.

## Authentication
Docs page: https://www.are.na/developers/explore/authentication

### POST /v3/oauth/token

- Label: Obtain access token
- Docs: https://www.are.na/developers/explore/authentication/post-token
- Markdown: https://www.are.na/developers/explore/authentication/post-token.md
- Requires resource id: no
- Response content type: application/json

Exchange credentials for an access token. This is the OAuth 2.0 token endpoint.

**Supported Grant Types:**

- `authorization_code`: Exchange an authorization code for an access token
- `authorization_code` + PKCE: For public clients without a client secret
- `client_credentials`: Authenticate as your application (server-to-server)

**PKCE Support:** For public clients (mobile apps, SPAs), use PKCE:
1. Generate a random `code_verifier` (43-128 chars, alphanumeric + `-._~`)
2. Create `code_challenge` = Base64URL(SHA256(code_verifier))
3. In the authorization request to `https://www.are.na/oauth/authorize`, include:
   - `code_challenge`: The generated challenge
   - `code_challenge_method`: `S256`
4. When exchanging the code at this endpoint, include `code_verifier`

See [RFC 7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) for details.

Access tokens do not expire and can be used indefinitely. Register your application
at [are.na/oauth/applications](https://www.are.na/oauth/applications) to obtain client credentials.

endpoint chooses between direct add and invitation automatically based
on the follow relationship.

### Invitation acceptance flow

Invitees receive an email with a tokenized URL that opens the Are.na web
UI. Accept and decline actions are handled there via GraphQL
(`acceptMembershipInvitation` and `declineMembershipInvitation`), not
through this REST API. There is no REST endpoint for invitees to list
their own pending invitations today; invitation discovery is email-link
based.

### POST /v3/groups/{id}/invitations

- Label: Add or invite a group member
- Docs: https://www.are.na/developers/explore/group/post-invitations
- Markdown: https://www.are.na/developers/explore/group/post-invitations.md
- Requires resource id: yes
- Response content type: application/json

Resolves a `user_id` or `email` into one of four outcomes and returns
which outcome occurred via the `outcome` field. HTTP status mirrors the
outcome: `201` when something was created (`added`, `invited`), `200`
when no work was needed (`already_member`, `invitation_pending`).

Resolution rules:

- `added`: The request targeted a `user_id` and that user already
  follows the caller. A group membership is created immediately. The
  "must follow caller" signal is treated as opt-in, so no invite/accept
  round trip is required.
- `invited`: A new pending invitation was created and an email was sent.
- `invitation_pending`: An open invitation for this user or email
  already exists; the existing invitation is returned unchanged.
- `already_member`: The user is already a member; no action is taken.

When invited by `email` and no user with that email exists, the caller
must have permission to invite new users.

**Authentication required.**

Path parameters:
- id: string (required) — Resource ID or slug
